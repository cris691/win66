## License

You can use this repo to play with a securely view documents remotely in the cloud, rather than on your own device. Useful for security and automation. 

If you're a developer you can include a "SecureView" in any other web application (for non-commercial use only).

If you're like to deploy this in your org, or for a for-profit project, write me: cris@dosycorp.com Or keep an eye out for the cloud service, coming soon. Official government use OK without purchase, as long as deployment is done in-house (or using Dosyago Corporation, not by other contractors, nor part of a paid deployment). If you're in government and you'd like to deploy this and want help, contact me for help or to discuss a deployment contract.
